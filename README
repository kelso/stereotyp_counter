StereotypCounter
=================

Little help to webmasters who must edit static html pages.
It's a ruby script.

For example we have this gallery:
<img src="/images/img_1.jpg" />
<img src="/images/img_2.jpg" />
<img src="/images/img_3.jpg" />

Now, customer wants to add new images. And you must copy&paste
so many times and rewrite the number of photo. Don't waste
your time, use the Stereotyp.

Usage
=====

ruby ./stereotyp.rb 'image_***.jpg' 2 5

output:
image_2.jpg
image_3.jpg
image_4.jpg
image_5.jpg

First parameter is a string, where *** are replaced
by number in cycle. Second and third parameter defines
start and end position in cycle.

Start number can be larger than end number (use if order of your
gallery images are descending).
